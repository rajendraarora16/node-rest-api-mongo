# RESTful API

This is a RESTful API example based on Node.js and MongoDB, following the **MVC pattern** i.e. Model ~~View~~ Controller.

**Mongoose** is used for Database transactions which is an elegant solution to mongodb object modeling for node.js.

The application is **production ready**, and can be used behind a Nginx reverse proxy securely.
